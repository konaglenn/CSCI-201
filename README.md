# CSCI-201
This is a test website to host a p5 project for CSCI 201. It is a program previously created by Professors Peck and Meng, and edited by Kona Glenn (myself) in order to learn the basics of P5JS. My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/konaglenn/sketches/y07KKXO1V]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note in the program the balls bounce back and forth across the pre-defined screen frame.

The website that runs the program is at [X].
